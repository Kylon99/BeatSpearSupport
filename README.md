# ![IMG](BeatSpearSupport/Resources/BeatSpear64.png) Beat Spear Support

This mod provides support for playing Beat Saber in Spear mode.  When the option is 
enabled, Standard and No Arrows maps will be converted to One Color, with both
sabers being able to hit both blocks.  Scoring will also be disabled.  One Saber maps
will not be transformed and you can use No Arrows on those instead to play.

The idea behind playing Spear is to mount your controller or screw on a Vive Tracker
onto a long shaft and wield it like a spear. More explanations on the best ways to
do this will be coming in this README later.
