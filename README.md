# ![IMG](BeatSpearSupport/Resources/BeatSpear64.png) Beat Spear Support

This mod supports playing Beat Saber in Spear mode.  In the modifiers panel, select Beat Spear Settings and you will see four options to choose from:

* Two Controller Spear - Use your regular two controllers to control a two-handed
spear.  While you play you can press trigger on the hand you wish to be the forward hand.  Do not use this with Darth Maul mode.

* One Color - Modifies the Standard and No Arrows maps into One Color with No Arrows.  Can be used for Spear mode or independently with other mods.

* Left Spear - Uses the left saber and its color instead of the right to start. Haptic feedback is also on the left hand instead of the right.

* Remove Other Spear - Disables the offhand spear that you are not using.  Do not use this with Darth Maul mode.

You can still play Spear mode by mounting a controller or a Vive Tracker onto a long shaft and wield it like a physical spear.  In that case do not select the Two Controller Spear option.
